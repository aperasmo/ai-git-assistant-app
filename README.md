# AI Git Assistant

**Use plain English to manage your Git projects - no commands to memorise.**

AI Git Assistant is a Windows desktop app that turns what you want to do into the exact Git steps needed. Type something like *"commit all my changes with message 'Fix login bug'"* and the app shows you exactly what it will run - before running anything. You review, you approve, it executes.

---

## Current app

AI Git Assistant now includes the **Phase C Git client feature set**:

- Plain-English Git planning with review-before-run approval
- Local repository management: add, initialise, clone, and remember repos
- Local planner plus optional LLM fallback for Anthropic, Gemini, OpenAI, Groq, and Ollama
- Full diff viewer, commit graph, branch list, remote status, release tags, file history, and blame
- Stash list, stash inspection, apply, pop, and drop
- Commit, push, pull, branch switching, branch creation/deletion, staging, unstaging, and discard flows
- Merge workflow with conflict detection, conflict snippets, guided continue, and abort
- Diagnostics panel, local log viewer/export, encrypted API key storage, and repeatable Windows installer builds

---

## What it does

- **Understands plain English** - type what you want, not `git add -A && git commit -m "…"`
- **Shows every step before running** - nothing happens without your approval
- **Works with any Git repository** on your machine
- **Gives you Git-client visibility** - inspect diffs, history, blame, branches, stashes, remotes, and conflicts
- **Connects to an AI provider** (optional) so it can understand requests the built-in patterns don't cover
- **Safe by design** - no force pushes, no hard resets, no surprises

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or 11 (64-bit)
- [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) installed

That's it. No Python, no Node.js, nothing else to install.

---

## Installation

1. Download **`AI Git Assistant_0.3.0_x64-setup.exe`** from the [Releases](https://github.com/aperasmo/ai-git-assistant-app/releases) page
2. Double-click the installer and follow the prompts
3. Launch **AI Git Assistant** from your Start menu or desktop shortcut

> Your settings and repositories are saved in `C:\Users\<you>\.ai-git-assistant\` and survive reinstalls and updates.

---

## Quick start (5 minutes)

### 1 - Add your repository

Click **+ Add** in the left sidebar and select your project folder.
The app automatically reads your branches, changed files, and remote connections.

### 2 - Run a command using the command bar

The bar at the bottom has two rows of buttons:

| Row | What it does |
|-----|-------------|
| **READ** | View status, diffs, commits, graph, branches, stashes, remotes, history, blame, conflicts |
| **WRITE** | Commit, push, pull, switch branch, stash, merge, stage, unstage, discard, and more |

Click any button and the app walks you through it step by step.

### 3 - Or just type what you want

Use the text box at the very bottom. Examples that work right away:

```
what changed?
show recent commits
show diff
show commit graph
history README.md
blame README.md
show stashes
show remotes
show tags
show tag v0.3.0
show conflicts
commit all my changes with message "Fix login bug"
push and commit everything with message "Add dark mode"
stage changes then commit and push with message "Update readme"
switch to main
create branch feature/new-login
stash my changes
merge feature/new-login
create tag v0.3.0 with message "Release v0.3.0"
push tag v0.3.0
```

The app turns your sentence into a Git plan and shows it to you before doing anything.

## Setting up AI (optional but recommended)

The built-in planner handles most common requests. For everything else - unusual phrasing, complex multi-step tasks - you can connect an AI provider and the app becomes fully conversational.

### Step 1 - Get an API key

Choose one provider (all have free tiers or cheap pay-as-you-go):

| Provider | Sign up | Best for |
|----------|---------|----------|
| **Anthropic (Claude)** | [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com) | Most accurate |
| **Groq** | [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com) | Fastest, generous free tier |
| **Google Gemini** | [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com) | Free tier |
| **OpenAI** | [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com) | Widely known |
| **Ollama** | [ollama.com](https://ollama.com) | 100% local, no key needed, requires separate install |

### Step 2 - Add it to the app

1. Click **Settings** in the top-right corner
2. Choose your provider from the dropdown
3. Paste your API key
4. Click **Save**
5. Click **Test connection** to confirm it works

### Step 3 - That's it

From now on, any request the app doesn't recognise locally is automatically sent to your AI provider. You still see and approve every step - the AI just figures out what steps to take.

---

## The approval screen

Every write operation (commit, push, branch, etc.) shows a plan like this before running:

```
1. Stage 3 files
   git add -- src/App.tsx src/login.py README.md

2. Create commit
   git commit -m "Fix login bug"

3. Push to origin
   git push origin main
```

Click **Approve and execute** to run it, or **Cancel** to go back. Nothing ever runs without your explicit approval.

- **Status view** - staged, modified, untracked, and conflicted files
- **Full patch diff** - line-by-line additions and removals
- **Commit graph** - visual history across branches
- **File history** - follow changes to a specific file
- **Blame** - see who last changed each line
- **Stash tools** - list, inspect, apply, pop, and drop stashes
- **Remote view** - see configured remotes and refresh ahead/behind counts
- **Release tags** - list, inspect, create, push, and delete explicit tags

## Git command reference

Click **Help** in the top-right corner for a full reference of every supported command - including syntax, examples, and which ones require a terminal.

---

## Troubleshooting

**"Git check pending" in the top bar**
Git for Windows is not installed or not on your PATH.
Download it from [git-scm.com/download/win](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and restart the app.

**"The local planner did not recognise this request"**
Either rephrase your request, or set up an AI provider in Settings - it will handle anything the built-in patterns miss.

**Test connection shows an error**
Double-check your API key. Make sure you clicked **Save** before clicking **Test connection**.

**Ollama: connection failed**
Ollama must be running before the app can use it. Open a terminal and run `ollama serve`, then try again.
Also make sure you have pulled a model first: `ollama pull deepseek-r1:8b`

**Something failed and you want to report it**
Open the diagnostics panel and export the local logs. The log export is designed for bug reports and support.

**The app remembered my repositories from a previous install**
Settings and repo list are stored in `C:\Users\<you>\.ai-git-assistant\ai-git-assistant.db`.
Delete that file for a completely clean start.

---

## Privacy

- Your code and file contents are **never sent anywhere**
- Only the **names of changed files**, current **branch**, and your **typed request** are sent to the AI provider when the AI fallback is used
- API keys are stored locally with Windows encryption
- If you use Ollama, everything stays on your machine - nothing leaves your computer
